# Preposal-and-Github-Lab-fall-1051
 ## What will (likely) be the title of your project? 
Running maze!

 ## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.") 
A unity app, using it as a horror maze where maybe a monster comes after you.

 ## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed? 
My software will allow the user to run, and add a feature to hide in a closet, or couch down to holes. Itâ€™s the user's goal to reach the end of the hallway. Escaping from the monster(not sure if I will add a monster) will executed from a horror theme.

 ## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course? 
none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below. 
None (sadly by myself)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
 I finally made the map of a maze with a running feature all i wanted to accomplish.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
If i were to have more time maybe a monster chase would happen or having items to help with the game.

 ### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
The best outcome would be to finish everything which is running, a map, adding a monster and items as well as the end scene. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what? 
My skill would be able to learn to build a map. My research would be how to even run in the first place, getting to pick up items which i think i would have more problem to put down the coding. Having doing everything by myself seem fun but same time more work.
